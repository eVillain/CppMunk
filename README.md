CppMunk: A C++11 wrapper for Chipmunk2D Physics (https://chipmunk-physics.net/).

    --- Current feature set ---
Most features from Chipmunk2D 7.0.1 are fully wrapped into C++.
Collision callbacks are also supported using the Arbiter class.

      --- TODO List ---
Wrap PolyLine, March as well as assorted utility functions from chipmunk_unsafe.
Implement constraint callbacks.
Write unit tests.
Clean up and add comments to header files, constraints are done but the rest needs to be checked.

All the wrapper code is public domain.
